"""Metric computation for extraction evaluation.

All metrics operate on log10 space since limit data spans many orders of magnitude.

Primary metric: interpolation-based comparison.
  1. Build a log-log interpolation function from extracted data points.
  2. Evaluate it at the ground-truth mass values.
  3. Report residuals (log10 coupling error) at each GT point.

This directly answers: "if a physicist uses the extracted curve, how wrong
is it at the masses where we know the true answer?"

# Confidence-calibration accuracy threshold (issue #542).
#
# A paper counts as "accurate" iff its median interpolation residual is below
# this threshold (in dex). It is pinned to the *extraction noise floor*, NOT
# relaxed to the upstream-digitization floor:
#
#   * Extraction noise floor (BINDING): ~0.32 dex. This is the 90th-percentile
#     of the per-paper median-residual standard deviation across repeated LLM
#     extraction runs of the same paper (PR #545). Run-to-run LLM
#     non-determinism alone moves a paper's median residual by up to ~0.32 dex,
#     so demanding accuracy tighter than that would penalise extractions for
#     irreducible sampling noise. THIS sets the threshold.
#
#   * Digitization floor (NOT binding): ~0.034 dex for TABLE/text-sourced
#     papers (PR #558, truly-independent gold-vs-repo, N=10). The repo ground
#     truth is faithful to papers that publish numbers — it is NOT the ~0.5 dex
#     floor the original #542 premise assumed. That premise ("0.3 dex is below
#     the digitization floor, so the yardstick is too strict") is therefore
#     FALSIFIED: the old 0.3 dex was roughly right, but for the wrong reason.
#
# Consequence: any residual overconfidence gap measured against this threshold
# is REAL extractor overconfidence, not a yardstick artifact.
#
# CAVEAT: the 0.034 dex digitization floor is measured only for table/text
# sources. For FIGURE-ONLY papers the upstream figure-digitization error is
# UNMEASURED (the gold_vision tier bounds the *combined* error at ~1.13 dex but
# does not isolate cajohare's own figure-digitization component), so this is
# not a universal floor.

        extraction noise floor from #545 — NOT the 0.034 dex digitization floor
        from #558; see the module-level note for why the threshold tracks
        noise, not digitization).
      - interpolation coverage >= ``accuracy_threshold_coverage``
        (default 50% of GT points). Coverage is retained because a paper that
        nails the coupling at only a sliver of the mass range is not a usable
        extraction — a low residual on 1-2 in-range points should not count as
        "accurate". It is a curve-quality gate, orthogonal to the residual
        floor, so both conditions are kept.

    In addition to the pass/fail ``actual_accuracy``, each bin reports the
    *continuous* residual distribution (median + IQR) and the empirical
    P(residual < tau) for each tau in ``taus``, so a bin shows the real residual
    distribution rather than only a thresholded rate.

    ``binning`` selects how papers are grouped:

    * ``"equal_width"`` (default): fixed 1/n_bins-wide confidence intervals.
      Simple, but models emit a small set of round confidence values, so the
      occupancy is wildly uneven and the sparse extreme bins are dominated by
      sampling noise.
    * ``"equal_count"``: tie-aware quantile bins targeting equal occupancy.
      Because a confidence value cannot be split across bins (models reuse a
      handful of round values), occupancy is equalized only as far as the ties
      allow; the binner rebalances its target after each closed bin. This is
      what the manuscript reports, so every bin carries comparable statistical
      weight and no bin's accuracy rests on a handful of papers.
