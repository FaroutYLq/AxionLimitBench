# Vendored from AutoAxionLimits evaluation/conventions.py at master 73682236 (2026-09-09); import paths rewritten, no logic changes.
"""Coupling convention/units inference for ground-truth entries.

A "coupling type" (e.g. ``AxionMass``, ``DarkPhoton``) does NOT pin down the
*variable* or *units* on the y-axis. The same physics is published in several
conventions, and the repo data files are not internally consistent. Comparing
two different conventions produces multi-dex residuals that are NOT extraction
error. This module derives, per data file, a canonical ``coupling_convention``
string and a human-readable ``coupling_units`` string so the evaluation can
refuse to compare across conventions.

Derivation rules:
  * The canonical convention/units come from ``pipeline.config.COUPLING_TYPES``
    ``axes["y"]`` for the data file's coupling type (keyed by its
    ``limit_data/<dir>/`` directory, the same dir→coupling logic used in
    ``evaluate.py``).
  * For couplings with a known multi-convention trap (``AxionMass``/``fa``
    plane, ``DarkPhoton`` epsilon vs epsilon^2, ``ScalarPhoton``/
    ``ScalarElectron`` d_e vs a large-valued variable), the actual convention
    is inferred from the data file's coupling value range.
